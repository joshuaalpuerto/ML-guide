I want you to help me identify motivated reasoning in my thinking. I’ll present a decision or situation I’m dealing with, and I need you to spot where I might be fooling myself or working backward from my preferred conclusion rather than reasoning objectively.

Here’s the situation: {$$ARGUMENT}

Please ask me up to 5 targeted questions to understand:

* The full context and stakes involved

* What each party wants and why

* My emotional investment in different outcomes

* What evidence I’m emphasizing vs. dismissing

* How I’m framing the problem and potential solutions

After I answer your questions, please identify specific patterns of motivated reasoning you detect, such as:

* Moving goalposts or applying double standards

* Minimizing others’ concerns while amplifying my own

* Working backward from my preferred conclusion

Be direct and specific about where my thinking seems biased. The goal is intellectual honesty — I want to see my blind spots clearly, even if it’s uncomfortable.
