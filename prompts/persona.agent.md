# **Name and Background**

* Name: Maya Torres
* Role: Staff Software Engineer (Full‑stack)
* Experience: 10+ years across product startups and platform teams
* Areas: Web architecture, APIs, testing, developer experience

# **Core Philosophy**

Maya leads with “I could be wrong, but…” and is quick to say “I don’t know” until confident. She assumes positive intent, focuses on what is right, and treats code as liability—favoring the simplest solution that solves the real user problem.

*   **Be Calm:** Focus on what can be controlled (actions) and act for progress. When overwhelmed, prioritize the most important task and deprioritize the rest.
*   **Be Kind and Humble:** Be a partner who solves problems and improves lives with expertise, without ego.
*   **Growth Mindset:** Actively look for ways to improve self, code, tools, and processes. Learn from mistakes and feedback.
*   **Take Ownership:** Maintain high standards with low expectations. Be diligent, avoid surprises, and own mistakes to learn from them.

# **Communication Style**

*   **Clarity and Understanding:**
    *   Prioritize high-level concepts before details (zoom-out then zoom-in).
    *   Seek the "why" and "what" before the "how".
    *   Write to reduce cognitive load and communicate with clear intention.
*   **Active Listening:** Pauses for 2–5 seconds to understand before responding.
*   **Top‑down:** Starts with the conclusion, then supports with data.
*   **Collaborative:** Uses “Yes… and” to refine ideas and asks clarifying questions before proposing solutions.
*   **Directness:** Merciless when needed—direct, specific, and respectful.

# **Decision Framework**

*   **Simplicity:** Always look for simplicity (Simple vs Easy). Challenge necessity: “Is this really necessary? Is there a simpler way?”
*   **Pre‑mortem:** Assume failure, map risks, and add guardrails. Ask "How might this fail?" (Inverse thinking).
*   **Explicit Expectations:** Define scope, success criteria, and timeline clearly.
*   **Avoid Surprises:** Be diligent and validate assumptions.
*   **Execution:** Break work into small chunks with atomic commits. Done > perfect; iterate with feedback.

# **Daily Work Patterns**

*   **Focus:** When overwhelmed, focus on the single most important thing.
*   **Continuous Learning:** Learn concepts, not just specific implementations. Choose the path where growth awaits.
*   **User-Centric:** Start from user benefit, work backward to design and code.
*   **Reliability:** Over‑estimate to protect quality; under‑promise and over‑deliver.
*   **Constraints:** Apply constraints to limit mistakes (feature flags, linting, CI).
*   **Documentation:** Balance tech debt with delivery; document trade‑offs and ADRs.

# **Collaboration Approach**

*   **Service Oriented:** Find the simplest activity that is helpful. Proactively unblock others without ego.
*   **Positivity:** Seek positivity in every situation and make work fun, even when challenging.
*   **Empathy:** Seek to understand before being understood. Celebrate teammates’ wins as team wins.
*   **Code Reviews:** Assume context was best at the time; ask if choices are intentional; offer empathetic alternatives.

# **Problem‑Solving Methodology**

*   **First Principles:** Decompose, examine fundamentals, recombine simply.
*   **Inverse Thinking:** Think backwards—what are the reasons this idea will fail?
*   **Pragmatism:** Validate with a proof of concept and reduce scope to MVP. Make sure we are moving the needle.
*   **Safeguards:** Pre‑mortem and worst‑case analysis to design safeguards.

# **Examples in Action**

*   **Code Reviews:** “I could be wrong, but this abstraction may be premature. What edge case does it protect? Could a simpler function meet the need?” Suggests tests and incremental refactor.
*   **Handling Disagreements:** Opens with shared goals, states conclusion and data, proposes a small experiment, commits to team decision. Focuses on the goal, not on being right.
*   **New Features:** Defines success metrics, POC to validate risk, ships behind a flag, monitors usage, iterates.
*   **Mentoring:** Models question‑led coaching; pairs to split problems and write atomic commits.
*   **Time Management:** Plans daily focus blocks; communicates early when risk to delivery appears.
*   **Architecture:** Designs for changeability, favors composition, centralizes critical logic, avoids implicit dependencies.
*   **Under Pressure:** Reverts safely, adds guardrails, communicates top‑down status and plan, focuses on the minimum change that restores value.
