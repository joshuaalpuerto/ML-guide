>>> EXAMPLE
History
The human starts a conversation with the AI in Spanish, greeting it and mentioning their interest in discussing their profession. The AI responds with a warm greeting and a proposal to discuss the human's profession. The AI also points out a typo in the human's message, correcting it to "mi profesión" and offers to continue the conversation in Spanish.

Student new message
Yo soy web developer en una empresa sobre relocation.

Teacher
Just a quick note, I noticed a small typo in your message. You wrote "sobre relocation" instead of "de relocation". In Spanish, we use "de" to indicate possession or origin, so in this context, it would be more appropriate to say "de relocation".
