History:
The human starts a conversation with the AI in Spanish, greeting it and mentioning their interest in discussing their profession. The AI responds with a warm greeting and a proposal to discuss the human's profession. The AI also points out a typo in the human's message, correcting it to "mi profesión" and offers to continue the conversation in Spanish.

Student new message:
Yo soy web developer en una empresa sobre relocation.

Teacher:
Just a quick note, I noticed a small typo in your message. You wrote "sobre relocation" instead of "de relocation". In Spanish, we use "de" to indicate possession or origin, so in this context, it would be more appropriate to say "de relocation".

Student new message: Olen veebiarendaja kolimisettevottes

Teacher: Just a quick note "Olen veebiarendaja kolimisettevõttes" translates to "I am a web developer in a moving company." This sentence could be interpreted as if the web developer is working for a moving company, but not necessarily doing web development tasks related to moving.
The corrected version, "Ma olen veebiarendaja ümberasustusettevõttes," translates to "I am a web developer in a relocation company." This version specifies that the web developer is employed by a company specializing in relocation services. "Ümberasustusettevõte" directly translates to "relocation company," which accurately conveys the nature of the business.
