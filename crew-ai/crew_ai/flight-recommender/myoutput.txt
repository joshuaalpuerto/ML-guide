[DEBUG]: Working Agent: Destination researcher

[INFO]: Starting Task: 
You must compile THE latest
in-depth guide for someone traveling and wanting 
to have THE BEST trip ever!
You have tools access to gather information about key attractions, local customs,
special events, and daily activity recommendations.
Search for the best spots to go to, the kind of place only a
local would know.
Base on what you search, you should provide a thorough overview of what 
the city has to offer, including hidden gems, cultural
hotspots, must-visit landmarks, weather forecasts, and
high level costs.

The final answer must be a comprehensive city guide, 
rich in cultural insights and practical tips, 
tailored to enhance the travel experience.
