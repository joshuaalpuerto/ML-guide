Thank\nyou!\n\n## 25 Best Things to Do in Madrid\n\n### El Retiro Park\n\n**Wander this enormous park from the 19th century to see its gardens, art\ngalleries, and boat-filled lake.**\n\n_Sitting area at El Retiro Park  _\n\n📍 Google Maps | Website | Hours: 6 am – 10 pm daily | Entrance: Free |\n**👉Browse Tours on Viator**\n\nParks are such a peaceful peek into the local life of a city, and Madrid’s El\nRetiro Park is perfect for catching a glimpse. This place is huge and was once\nenjoyed as a getaway for Spanish kings.\n\nToday, it’s one of the largest public parks in Madrid and there are plenty of\nactivities. Visitors flock to the park’s bountiful rose garden and the\nVelazquez Palace art gallery. Alternatively, if you want a more hands-on\nactivity, you can rent a row boat and set off on the park’s lake.\n\nPlus, if you haven’t booked your accommodations yet, this neighborhood is one\nof the **best places to stay in Madrid**.\n\n**👉 Pro Tip:** There are lots of welcoming, chill green spaces in the big city\nof Madrid. After you visit El Retiro, check out Casa de Campo and Campo del\nMoro if you’re a park fanatic like me.\n\n### Palacio de Cristal\n\n**Stop by this totally transparent structure in El Retiro that occasionally\nhosts art exhibitions.**\n\n_The massive Crystal Palace inside Retiro Park_\n\n📍 Google Maps | Phone: (917)-741-000 | Website | Hours: 10 am – 6 pm daily |\nEntrance: Free | **👉Browse Tours on Viator**\n\nOut of all the interesting things to see and do at Retiro, Palacio de Cristal\nwas the thing that sticks to my mind like honey. I didn’t even get the full\nexperience because I just visited on a random afternoon, but I was still in\nawe. The Glass Palace was just so unique all on its own.\n\nHowever, if you’re more planning-savvy or lucky than me, you can catch one of\nthe rotating art exhibits here. The Reina Sofia Museum puts on shows inside\nthis mammoth piece of window-filled architecture from time to time.\n\n### Royal Palace of Madrid\n\n**Gain access to the official residence of the Spanish royal family and its\nrooms full of art.**\n\n_The facade of the Royal Palace (photo: Angelo DAmico / Shutterstock)_\n\n📍 Google Maps | Phone: (914)-548-700 | Website | Hours: 10 am – 6 pm daily, 10\nam – 4 pm Sundays | Entrance: $13.05, adults, Free under age 5 | **👉Browse\nTours on Viator**\n\nYou can see how the other side lives when you buy a ticket to the Royal Palace\nof Madrid. This opulent castle was built for King Philip V and is still the\nresidence of the Spanish royal family on paper. However, these days, it’s only\nreally used for state ceremonies and groups of eager tourists.\n\nThe Royal Palace of Madrid is actually the largest Royal Palace in western\nEurope. You will never guess how many rooms this insanely large palace has.\n47? 205? 700?\n\nNope. There are over 3,000 rooms inside this giant estate. Just wrap your mind\naround that for a second. Of course, guests can’t explore every single one,\nbut the places they can see are packed with irreplaceable antiques and\nartwork.\n\n**👉 Pro Tip:** This **Madrid Walking Tour and The Royal Palace with Skip the\nLine Tickets **is definitely the best tour to see the palace. You get quick\naccess to this super busy tourist attraction and they give you a rundown of\nthe city streets, too.\n\n### Mercado de San Miguel\n\n**Grab tapas at this over 100-year-old market.**\n\n_This incredible market gets very busy around Christmas time (photo: Mirko\nKuzmanovic / Shutterstock)_\n\n📍 Google Maps | Phone: (915)-424-936 | Website | Hours: 10 am – 12 am Sun-\nThurs, 10 am – 1 am Fri-Sat | Entrance: Free\n\nWandering around the equivalent of a grocery store to many people doesn’t\nreally jump off the page as an exciting activity in Madrid. But, if you’re\nlooking for me in a major city like Madrid, I’m probably at the market. They\nare a fun way to get involved with the local culture that comes with some\ndelicious food.\n\nIn Madrid, there are several cool markets, but I think the best is San Miguel\nMarket. This place has been serving up tapas for well over 100 years and\nthere’s a reason it’s still bursting with patrons.\n\nThere are 30 different stalls with top-notch gourmet tapas here. It’s a blast\nto try a handful of them instead of going to one restaurant for dinner."

The Reina Sofia Museum puts on shows inside\nthis mammoth piece of window-filled architecture from time to time.\n\n### Royal Palace of Madrid\n\n**Gain access to the official residence of the Spanish royal family and its\nrooms full of art.**\n\n_The facade of the Royal Palace (photo: Angelo DAmico / Shutterstock)_\n\n📍 Google Maps | Phone: (914)-548-700 | Website | Hours: 10 am – 6 pm daily, 10\nam – 4 pm Sundays | Entrance: $13.05, adults, Free under age 5 | **👉Browse\nTours on Viator**\n\nYou can see how the other side lives when you buy a ticket to the Royal Palace\nof Madrid. This opulent castle was built for King Philip V and is still the\nresidence of the Spanish royal family on paper. However, these days, it’s only\nreally used for state ceremonies and groups of eager tourists.\n\nThe Royal Palace of Madrid is actually the largest Royal Palace in western\nEurope. You will never guess how many rooms this insanely large palace has.\n47? 205? 700?\n\nNope. There are over 3,000 rooms inside this giant estate. Just wrap your mind\naround that for a second. Of course, guests can’t explore every single one,\nbut the places they can see are packed with irreplaceable antiques and\nartwork.\n\n**👉 Pro Tip:** This **Madrid Walking Tour and The Royal Palace with Skip the\nLine Tickets **is definitely the best tour to see the palace. You get quick\naccess to this super busy tourist attraction and they give you a rundown of\nthe city streets, too.\n\n### Mercado de San Miguel\n\n**Grab tapas at this over 100-year-old market.**\n\n_This incredible market gets very busy around Christmas time (photo: Mirko\nKuzmanovic / Shutterstock)_\n\n📍 Google Maps | Phone: (915)-424-936 | Website | Hours: 10 am – 12 am Sun-\nThurs, 10 am – 1 am Fri-Sat | Entrance: Free\n\nWandering around the equivalent of a grocery store to many people doesn’t\nreally jump off the page as an exciting activity in Madrid. But, if you’re\nlooking for me in a major city like Madrid, I’m probably at the market. They\nare a fun way to get involved with the local culture that comes with some\ndelicious food.\n\nIn Madrid, there are several cool markets, but I think the best is San Miguel\nMarket. This place has been serving up tapas for well over 100 years and\nthere’s a reason it’s still bursting with patrons.\n\nThere are 30 different stalls with top-notch gourmet tapas here. It’s a blast\nto try a handful of them instead of going to one restaurant for dinner.\n        DETAILED SUMMARY:"

Rich in history, art, and culture, Madrid offers a diverse range of landmarks and experiences that cater to all interests.

The squares & streets category includes Puerta del Sol, Plaza Mayor, Puerta de Alcalá, Plaza de Cibeles, Gran Vía, and Plaza de España. These landmarks offer a glimpse into Madrid's rich history and architectural heritage.\n\nMadrid is home to several world-class museums, including the \"Golden Triangle of Art\" which consists of the Museo Nacional del Prado, Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, and Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza. The Prado Museum, designed by Juan de Villanueva in 1786, traces the history of European art from the 12th to the 19th century and houses more than 7,000 paintings, 900 sculptures, and countless drawings and other artifacts. The Reina Sofía Museum exhibits modern and contemporary art, with works by Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dalí, and Joan Miro. The Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum mostly has paintings covering a period from the 13th century to the 1950s and the emergence of pop art.\n\nIn addition to its museums, Madrid is also home to several famous monuments, such as the Royal Palace of Madrid, the largest royal palace in Western Europe, and the Catedral de la Almudena. The Temple of Debod, an Egyptian temple from 2,200 years ago, is a gift to Spain in 1968 and offers one of the most beautiful views of Madrid. For sports fans, the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, home to the famous Real Madrid team, is a must-visit landmark.\n\nFor those looking for hidden gems and cultural hotspots, Madrid has plenty to offer. The Mercado de San Miguel is a great place to have lunch and experience the city's vibrant food culture. The Palacio de Cristal in El Retiro Park is a beautiful iron and glass structure that is now part of the Queen Sofia Museum. The Royal Basilica of Saint Francis the Great is a work of classicism from the 18th century and contains an important art gallery in the cloister.\n\nEl Rastro, Madrid’s most famous open-air flea market, has 3,500 stalls where you can hunt for unique treasures, vintage goods, and quirky finds every Sunday. The Cibeles Fountain, dominated by the goddess Cybele, is a sight to behold and is considered one of the top attractions in Madrid. The Malasaña neighborhood exudes a bohemian spirit and is a haven for those seeking an offbeat and creative atmosphere. La Almudena Cathedral, the most important Catholic church in Madrid, combines styles with a neoclassical exterior and a neogothic interior.\n\nMadrid is a city of art, culture, and history, but not many locals and visitors know that it is also a hub of street art. The city’s walls and alleys serve as canvases for local and international artists to express their creativity. Chueca neighborhood stands as a beacon of diversity and acceptance, with a vibrant nightlife and the Madrid Pride Festival, a joyful and empowering celebration of the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nThe Plaza de la Villa houses some of the best-preserved historical monuments in Madrid, such as the House and Tower of Lujanes, Casa de la Villa, and Casa de Cisneros.
