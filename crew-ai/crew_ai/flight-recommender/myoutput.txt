Stroll Plaza Mayor\n\nThe Plaza Mayor, which dates to the 15th century, is Madrid’s main square.\nWhile walking this plaza, which was designated a Spanish Property of Cultural\nInterest in 1985, don’t miss Ayuntamiento (the impressive city council\nbuilding), the Baroque Church of San Pedro, the 18th-century San Francisco el\nGrande Basilica, and Calle de Cuchilleros (a popular place to eat, but expect\ntourist prices).\n\n##### 2\\. Visit the Prado Museum\n\nThe Prado Museum (Museo Nacional del Prado) is one of the world’s greatest art\ngalleries and the main art museum in Spain. As one of the most-visited museums\nin the world, its dazzling display of around 20,000 works by the great\nEuropean masters is housed in an 18th-century building that opened as a museum\nin 1819.

Admission is 15 EUR.\n\n##### 3\\. Unwind in El Retiro Park\n\nOfficially known as The Buen Retiro Park, this is the main park of Madrid. A\nUNESCO World Heritage Site, it’s the perfect place to relax on a sunny day.\nThe park dates back to the 17th century and spans over 350 acres, making it\nthe largest and most popular green space in the city. There is a large lake\nwhere you can hire a rowboat, a monument to the victims of the Madrid\nterrorist bombings (which killed 193 people and injured over 2,000 in 2004),\nand the Crystal Palace (a 19th-century conservatory that once held a human\nzoo).\n\n##### 4\\. Visit the Palacio Real\n\nThis is the official residence of the King of Spain, though it is now only\nused for state ceremonies. The palace is partially open to the public and is\nfree for EU citizens on Wednesdays. Built in the 18th century, the palace is\nthe largest functioning palace in Europe, home to over 3,400 rooms.

Take a free walking tour\n\nFree walking tours are one of my favorite activities to do in a new city.\nYou’ll get the lay of the land, learn about the history and culture, and\nconnect with a local guide who can answer all your questions. New Europe, Free\nWalking Tours Madrid, and Cat’s Hostel Walking Tours are the best free tours\nin the city. Just remember to tip your guide at the end!\n\n##### 2\\. Check out Puerta del Sol\n\nThis is Madrid’s most famous and central square. Originally, it was the site\nof one of the east-facing city gates and was adorned with an image of the sun,\nhence the square’s name (“The Sun Gate”). The square is actually semi-circular\nin shape and owes its current form to the major renovation work carried out\nbetween 1854-60. There’s a stone slab on the ground in front of Casa de\nCorreos’ main entrance (the current headquarters of the Madrid regional\ngovernment) to mark kilometer 0 as this is also the center of Spain’s radial\nroad network. People congregate here on New Year’s Eve to celebrate under the\nclock on top of the Casa de Correos building. It’s tradition to eat a “lucky”\ngrape for each of the 12 strokes of midnight.\n\n##### 3\\. See flamenco dancers\n\nMadrid has been enjoying flamenco, Spain’s most famous style of dancing, since\nthe early 19th century. Based on the various folkloric music traditions of\nsouthern Spain, flamenco shows take place in many bars and taverns across the\ncity, such as Las Carboneras where you can enjoy a flamenco show with a glass\nof wine and some tapas for 42 EUR. The historic Corral de la Morería offers\nshows for 49.95 EUR, including a drink.\n\n##### 4\\. Visit the National Archaeological Museum"

Each region in the country has its\nown local dishes and food culture, all of which you can find in Madrid as it’s\nsomething of a culinary hub. Be sure to try local favorites such _patatas\nbravas_ (spicy potatoes), beef stew, _tortilla de patatas_ (Spanish omelet),\nand, of course, churros.\n\nYou can get cheap tapas and meals for around 8-15 EUR. If you want wine\nincluded, expect to spend about 20 EUR.

This gets you basic staples like pasta, rice, seasonal produce,\nand some meat.\n\n### Backpacking Madrid Suggested Budgets\n\nIf you’re backpacking Madrid, expect to spend around 55 EUR per day. This\nbudget covers staying in a hostel dorm, cooking most of your meals, limiting\nyour drinking, taking public transportation to get around, and doing mostly\nfree activities like free walking tours and relaxing in the parks. Add 10-20\nEUR per day to your budget if you plan on drinking or partying a lot.\n\nOn a mid-range budget of 140 EUR per day, you can stay in a private Airbnb or\nprivate hostel room, eat out at cheap restaurants for most meals, enjoy a few\ndrinks, take the occasional taxi to get around, and do more paid activities\nlike cooking classes and museum visits.\n\nOn a “luxury” budget of 275 EUR or more per day, you can stay in a hotel, eat\nout anywhere you want, drink as much as you’d like, take more taxis, and do as\nmany guided tours as you want. This is just the ground floor for luxury\nthough. The sky is the limit!\n\nYou can use the chart below to get an idea of how much you need to budget\ndaily. Keep in mind these are daily averages – some days you spend more, some\ndays you spend less (you might spend less every day). We just want to give you\na general idea of how to make your budget. Prices are in EUR.\n\nAccommodation\n\nFood\n\nTransportation\n\nAttractions\n\nAverage Daily Cost\n\nBackpacker\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n10\n\n55\n\nMid-Range\n\n75\n\n40\n\n15\n\n20\n\n140\n\nLuxury\n\n120\n\n90\n\n25\n\n40\n\n275\n\n### Madrid Travel Guide: Money-Saving Tips\n\nMadrid can be an expensive city, especially if you indulge in the city’s famed\nfood and drink. Those costs can add up quickly. Fortunately, you can trim your\ncosts if you follow a few simple tips and tricks. Here are some general ways\nto save money in Madrid:\n\n  * **Eat a large lunch** – Lunch is much cheaper than dinner in Madrid and you can find “menu del día” which costs around 10-15 EUR for a large meal with a glass of wine or beer.\n  * **Get the Madrid tourist card** – The often-overlooked Madrid Card offers free public transportation, free access to Prado and other museums, as well as all sorts of discounts at nightclubs, entertainment facilities, shops, and restaurants. You can purchase a 24-hour card for 47 EUR, a 48-hour card for 60 EUR, a 72-hour card for 67 EUR, or a 120-hour card for 77 EUR.\n  * **Embrace free museum days** – Lots of museums in Madrid are free on certain days or at certain times throughout the day. Be sure to check before you go because it’s far better to see sights like the Prado for free! You can ask at the tourism office as they hold a list there.\n  * **Stay with a local** – Couchsurfing is a great way to save money on accommodation while also getting some insight from the locals. While hostels aren’t too expensive in the city, this is still the best way to save money and connect with an insider who can share their expert tips and advice.\n  * **Take a free walking tour** – This is one of my favorite ways to get to know a new destination — and you can’t beat the price! New Europe Walking Tours and Cat’s Hostel Walking Tours are the two most popular free tours in the city.\n  * **Grocery shop at the markets** – Fresh food can be bought for cheap at some of the daily markets in the city. Check out the Mercado de la Paz or Mercado de Maravillas for fresh produce and meat. You’ll save a ton compared to the supermarket. \n  * **Bring a water bottle** – The tap water here is safe to drink so bring a reusable water bottle to save money and reduce your plastic use. LifeStraw is my go-to brand as their bottles have built-in filters to ensure your water is always clean and safe.\n\n### Where to Stay in Madrid\n\nMadrid has a ton of hostel choices. Here are the best hostels in Madrid:\n\n  * The Hat Hostel\n  * OK Hostel\n  * Barbieri Sol Hostel\n  * Sungate One\n  * Cats Hostel\n\n### How to Get Around Madrid\n\n  \n**Public transportation** – The best way to get around Madrid is to use the\nsubway or take tbe us. The base fare is 1.50 EUR for the first five stations\n(one-way) then an additional 0.10 EUR for each additional station up to a 2\nEUR maximum in central Madrid.\n\nPublic buses run all over Madrid from 6:30am-11:30pm (with some night routes\nalso) and they cost the same as the metro. You can also get 10-journey cards\nfrom 11.20 EUR depending on your zones.\n\nTourist passes are available for unlimited usage on all public transportation,\nranging from 1-7 days. They cost 8.40-70.80 EUR depending on the zones you\nneed.\n\n**Bicycle** – Madrid has an electric bike-sharing program called BiciMAD.\nRentals start at 2 EUR per hour and then it’s 4 EUR per extra hour.\n\n**Taxis** – Taxis start at 3.25 EUR and then 1.10 EUR per additional\nkilometer. Skip them if you can as prices add up fast!\n\n**Ridesharing** – Uber is available in Madrid.\n\n**Car rental** – Car rentals can be found for as little as 25 EUR per day for\na multi-day rental, however, you don’t need a car to get around the city.\nUnless you’re going to explore the surrounding region, skip the car rental.\n\n### When to Go to Madrid\n\nMadrid is a year-round destination like the rest of Spain, but during peak\nseason (June-August) crowds are heavy, prices are highest, and the heat is\noppressive. Daily temperatures soar well above 30°C (86°F) in the summer so\nplan for hot weather. While the city is lively, you’ll need to book everything\nin advance as places sell out.",

  "text": "**Bicycle** – Madrid has an electric bike-sharing program called BiciMAD.\nRentals start at 2 EUR per hour and then it’s 4 EUR per extra hour.\n\n**Taxis** – Taxis start at 3.25 EUR and then 1.10 EUR per additional\nkilometer. Skip them if you can as prices add up fast!\n\n**Ridesharing** – Uber is available in Madrid.\n\n**Car rental** – Car rentals can be found for as little as 25 EUR per day for\na multi-day rental, however, you don’t need a car to get around the city.\nUnless you’re going to explore the surrounding region, skip the car rental.\n\n### When to Go to Madrid\n\nMadrid is a year-round destination like the rest of Spain, but during peak\nseason (June-August) crowds are heavy, prices are highest, and the heat is\noppressive. Daily temperatures soar well above 30°C (86°F) in the summer so\nplan for hot weather. While the city is lively, you’ll need to book everything\nin advance as places sell out.\n\nPersonally, I think the shoulder season is the best time to visit Madrid\n(April-May and September-October). Tourist sites are much less congested and\nprices for accommodation are lower. Temperatures are pleasant, with average\ntemperatures hovering around 64°F (18°C). Just bring a raincoat in case there\nare brief showers.\n\nVisiting in the winter is also doable, though the days can be chilly. While\nthe weather isn’t great, you’ll get much of the sights to yourself and prices\nwill be lower. Expect daily highs around 10°C (50°F).\n\n### How to Stay Safe in Madrid\n\nMadrid is a safe city. Violent crime is very rare , though pickpocketing and\npetty theft are common, especially in the major tourist areas and on the\nmetro. You need to be really careful with your stuff and always watch your\npockets when you’re out and about — especially while on public transportation.\nThe pickpockets here (and in Spain in general) a very talented!\n\nIf you go out at night, only bring the money you need. Leave the rest in your\naccommodation just in case.\n\nSolo female travelers should feel safe here. However, the standard precautions\napply (don’t leave your drink unattended at the bar, don’t walk around\nintoxicated at night, etc.). You can visit any one of the numerous solo female\ntravel blogs for specific tips as they will be able to provide advice.\n\nTourist scams are prevalent in the city so keep an eye out for groups of kids\ntrying to distract you, as they’re probably trying to take your money.\nMoreover, be wary of people offering to carry your luggage as they may try to\ncharge you a large fee for the service. You can read about common travel scams\nto avoid here.\n\nIf you experience an emergency, dial 112 for assistance.\n\nWhen in doubt, always trust your instincts. Make copies of your personal\ndocuments, including your passport and ID, in case of an emergency.\n\nThe most important piece of advice I can offer is to purchase good travel\ninsurance. Travel insurance protects you against illness, injury, theft, and\ncancellations. It’s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong. I\nnever go on a trip without it as I’ve had to use it many times in the past.\nYou can use the widget below to find the policy right for you:\n\n### Madrid Travel Guide: The Best Booking Resources\n\nThese are my favorite companies to use when I travel.

But maybe visiting Madrid in a day seems impossible. Have no fear! We\ntake the guesswork off your plate! This guide will fit perfectly for a one-day\nstay, and it also includes someexcellent guided tours that you can mix and\nmatch to get the most out of your visit._\n\n* * *\n\n**Pro Tip:** Planning what to do on your trip to Madrid? Bookmark this post in\nyour browser so you can easily find it when you’re in the city. Check out our\nMadrid guide for more planning resources, our best Madrid tours for a\nmemorable trip, and the top things to do in Madrid.\n\n## The Perfect Madrid In a Day Itinerary\n\nThe capital of Spain is a fascinating city, full of history, art, and\ncontagious vitality. Although we suggest spending more than just a day in\nMadrid, it can be hard to fit a longer stay into your schedule if you’re\ntraveling through the country.\n\nThe good news is that you can see Madrid in a day without missing out too much\nif you plan ahead. This guide lists the essential stops in the city center,\nand the itinerary will fit the bill if you want to explore the city on foot.\n\nBut you can also use public transportation to save time between each point of\nthis itinerary. Better yet, book your trips with a guide to skip the line at\nkey attractions and learn more about this beautiful city. Put your comfortable\nshoes in your luggage. Madrid in a day: that’s our mission!\n\nRather **explore Madrid** with a **guide? We can help**\n\nNot ready to book a tour yet? Check out our Madrid Guide for more info.\n\n### Getting To Madrid\n\nIf your flight arrives or departs from Madrid, use it to your advantage. Start\nyour trip from the capital, or choose it as the sweet end of the vacation and\nsave time on the journey.\n\nFrom the airport, you can get to the city center by metro or using the\nCercanias train which takes about 45-minutes. A taxi is also a good option and\nhas a fixed price of €30. If you need a car for more days, international\nrental companies have offices in front of the airport (you can also book it in\nadvance).\n\nOn the other hand, if you are in Spain already, the high-speed train (AVE)\nconnects all the major cities to Madrid. All AVE trains stop at the Atocha\nstation, a fantastic example of cast-iron architecture from the 19th century.\n\n### Enjoy a Morning Churro with Chocolate\n\nThere is no trip to Madrid that doesn’t involve churros. There are two\ntraditional fried dough breakfasts: tiny churros sprinkled with sugar, or\n_porras_ which are longer and can be filled with cream or chocolate.\n\nOur favorite is churros because they are a little crunchy and not too heavy.\nTraditionally, you pair them with hot chocolate, but if chocolate is not your\nthing, no worries. Pairing it with coffee or a latte ( _café con leche_ ) is\nperfectly acceptable.\n\nChurros are everywhere in Madrid: _churrerías_ , bars, and street trucks. But\nthe most important thing is that you eat them while they are still hot and\ncrunchy; otherwise, they will become soggy and unforgettable.\n\nChocolatería San Ginés is the best for hot chocolate and churros. The bar near\nPuerta del Sol recalls the cafés of the late 19th century, and their chocolate\nis so famous that they opened shops in Japan, China, Colombia, and Mexico in\nthe last ten years.\n\nSo if you want to eat churros there, you can be sure to have the best ones,\nbut you need to be patient because there is always a waiting line, especially\nduring winter.\n\n**Alternative:**  Close to San Ginés, Chocolatería 1902 is also a good option,\nand they have gluten-free churros.\n\nHow to see MADRID in a Day Guide\n\n  \nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nSee **Madrid Tours** You’ll Love\n\nNot ready to book a tour yet?

But maybe visiting Madrid in a day seems impossible. Have no fear! We\ntake the guesswork off your plate! This guide will fit perfectly for a one-day\nstay, and it also includes someexcellent guided tours that you can mix and\nmatch to get the most out of your visit._\n\n* * *\n\n**Pro Tip:** Planning what to do on your trip to Madrid? Bookmark this post in\nyour browser so you can easily find it when you’re in the city. Check out our\nMadrid guide for more planning resources, our best Madrid tours for a\nmemorable trip, and the top things to do in Madrid.\n\n## The Perfect Madrid In a Day Itinerary\n\nThe capital of Spain is a fascinating city, full of history, art, and\ncontagious vitality. Although we suggest spending more than just a day in\nMadrid, it can be hard to fit a longer stay into your schedule if you’re\ntraveling through the country.\n\nThe good news is that you can see Madrid in a day without missing out too much\nif you plan ahead. This guide lists the essential stops in the city center,\nand the itinerary will fit the bill if you want to explore the city on foot.\n\nBut you can also use public transportation to save time between each point of\nthis itinerary. Better yet, book your trips with a guide to skip the line at\nkey attractions and learn more about this beautiful city. Put your comfortable\nshoes in your luggage. Madrid in a day: that’s our mission!\n\nRather **explore Madrid** with a **guide? We can help**\n\nNot ready to book a tour yet? Check out our Madrid Guide for more info.\n\n### Getting To Madrid\n\nIf your flight arrives or departs from Madrid, use it to your advantage. Start\nyour trip from the capital, or choose it as the sweet end of the vacation and\nsave time on the journey.\n\nFrom the airport, you can get to the city center by metro or using the\nCercanias train which takes about 45-minutes. A taxi is also a good option and\nhas a fixed price of €30. If you need a car for more days, international\nrental companies have offices in front of the airport (you can also book it in\nadvance).\n\nOn the other hand, if you are in Spain already, the high-speed train (AVE)\nconnects all the major cities to Madrid. All AVE trains stop at the Atocha\nstation, a fantastic example of cast-iron architecture from the 19th century.\n\n### Enjoy a Morning Churro with Chocolate\n\nThere is no trip to Madrid that doesn’t involve churros. There are two\ntraditional fried dough breakfasts: tiny churros sprinkled with sugar, or\n_porras_ which are longer and can be filled with cream or chocolate.\n\nOur favorite is churros because they are a little crunchy and not too heavy.\nTraditionally, you pair them with hot chocolate, but if chocolate is not your\nthing, no worries. Pairing it with coffee or a latte ( _café con leche_ ) is\nperfectly acceptable.\n\nChurros are everywhere in Madrid: _churrerías_ , bars, and street trucks. But\nthe most important thing is that you eat them while they are still hot and\ncrunchy; otherwise, they will become soggy and unforgettable.\n\nChocolatería San Ginés is the best for hot chocolate and churros. The bar near\nPuerta del Sol recalls the cafés of the late 19th century, and their chocolate\nis so famous that they opened shops in Japan, China, Colombia, and Mexico in\nthe last ten years.\n\nSo if you want to eat churros there, you can be sure to have the best ones,\nbut you need to be patient because there is always a waiting line, especially\nduring winter.\n\n**Alternative:**  Close to San Ginés, Chocolatería 1902 is also a good option,\nand they have gluten-free churros.\n\nHow to see MADRID in a Day Guide\n\n  \nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nSee **Madrid Tours** You’ll Love\n\nNot ready to book a tour yet?

There’s a reason why this palace is\nsometimes compared to the Palace of Versailles—come see for yourself!\n\nGet your ticket in advance to the Royal Palace to avoid waiting times and\nmaximize your precious time here. Better yet, choose a guided tour with skip-\nthe-line tickets and an evening dining at a  _tablao_  with a flamenco show.\nOlé!\n\nOr you can really prioritize your day and book a guided tour of the Royal\nPalace, Retiro Park, and a stop for our favorite tapas in the city.

Check out our Madrid Guide for more info.\n\n### Flamenco Show and Tapas\n\nIf you’re in Madrid for just one day, you must save time for a flamenco\nshow—ideally with dinner or tapas. These whirlwind, folkloric dances have a\nlong heritage from southern Spain and are the highlights of many travelers’\ntime in Spain.\n\nThere are flamenco shows throughout the city, but since you’re only here for a\nday, it’s worth reserving your spot ahead of time at a place you’re sure to\nenjoy. You can book a flamenco show after visiting the Royal Palace, which is\nthe perfect way to end your day in Madrid. An authentic meal with a flamenco\nshow?

However, if you love\ncocktails, try 47 Cocktail Bar. The place is informal and welcoming, with a\nlong menu of cocktails and mocktails.\n\nMalasaña is the place to be if you feel comfortable in bohemian environments.\nHere is where _Movida_ bloomed in the 80s, and it is still a place to look for\nindependent pubs and live music. We suggest exploring mythical places from\nthat glorious decade, like La Vía Láctea, or dancing in clubs like Ochoymedio\nor Sala Maravillas.\n\nDivided from Malasaña by the long Fuencarral street, you’ll find the Chueca\narea. It is Madrid’s gay neighborhood, and it can easily be the best fun you\ncan have in the city, especially if you visit during Pride.\n\nLast but not least: Huertas. The area is known for its nightlife and its many\nIrish pubs, so don’t miss out on it if you head to Madrid on St. Patrick’s day\ncause the party is massive. You can find every style here, from rock pubs to\nDJ sessions to taverns that close late at night.\n\nYour day in Madrid just wouldn’t be complete without stopping in at any of\nthese fun bars and clubs that are a rich part of Madrid’s nightlife.

From the parks to the architecture,\nand the best places to eat tapas and drink wine, I’ve got you covered.\n\nIcy, snow topped mountains, frozen swimming pools, ski slopes and the\nbeautiful cascading light as the sun beamed down. The clouds sat lightly\nbrushing the frozen peaks. I felt a chill just from looking out of the plane\nwindow as I travelled to Madrid. January is officially low season across\nSpain. A country that I have always thought of as being warm and drenched in\nsunshine, was looking more like the Scottish highlands!\n\nIn my mind, Madrid was going to be somewhere I didn’t like. It would be\npolluted, busy, warm, and a bustling commercial city without a heart. I’m\npleased to say, I couldn’t have been more wrong. It’s the perfect place to jet\noff to on a city break, it’s relatively inexpensive, and the food is\nincredible! Here is how to spend the perfect 24 hours seeing the city.\n\n### How To Spend 24 Hours In Madrid\n\n**08.30:** Wake up under the shadow of the spectacular Palacio Real de Madrid\nat the Hotel Acta Madfor. With its long terrace you’ll have a spectacular view\nof the city from above, before setting off to explore it on foot.\n\n**10.00:** After breakfast take a wander north of the hotel to visit the\noldest monument in the city – the Temple of Debod. The series of gateways make\nup an ancient Egyptian temple presented to Spain by the Egyptian state. It was\noriginally located close to Aswan and dates back to 200BC. Their position over\na small pool of water creates spectacular reflections – perfect for taking\namazing photos.\n\n**11.00:** Next, head south through the luscious Sabatini Gardens, up to the\nPalacio Real de Madrid or Royal Palace of Madrid. It’s the largest in Europe,\nand as the royal family choose to live elsewhere, it’s open to the public most\nof the year.\n\nYou’ll feel very small standing under the Catedral de la Almudena which faces\nthe palace across the plaza, but if you’re feeling energetic you can climb the\ntower!\n\n**12.00:** After your fix of monuments and history, it’s time to walk up to\nthe hustle and bustle of the city. Follow Calle Mayor from the cathedral\ntowards Puerta Del Sol. Need a caffeine fix? Stop off at Chocolateria San\nGinés – a café which has been serving churros (crispy sticks of fried batter)\nwith hot chocolate sauce for well over 100 years. You’ll feel like you’ve gone\nback in time as much of the original décor remains, including the beautiful\nmarble-topped bar and ancient old wall-clock.\n\n**13.00:** After dunking a few churros, walk off that chocolate sauce in\nPuerta Del Sol – one of the busiest plazas in the city. Every year, this is\nthe focal point for New Year’s celebrations across Spain, and the square marks\nas the official ‘centre’ of the country. Take some photos of the famous El Oso\ny el Madroño (bear and the tree) statue and the Tio Pepe neon sign!\n\n**  \n14.00:** Getting hungry? You’ve lasted well! Spanish lunchtimes usually run\nfrom around 2-4pm. It’s time to walk down to one of the most delicious lunch\nstops in the city… Mercado San Miguel. This beautiful old market building has\nbeen regenerated and packed full of delicious food stalls with everything from\nSpanish tapas, to sushi, to luxurious ice creams. Just order a selection of\ndifferent items from the stalls and listen to the locals having animated\nconversations.\n\n****Don’t miss the delicious fried croquetas (1.50€ each) filled with truffle,\niberico ham, mushroom, spinach, cheese and more. Sample every olive you could\nimagine, then head to the stall specialising in burrata and mozzarella cheese.\nAlso sample the rocket, parma ham and sundried tomato rolled mozzarella\n(3.50€), and the cupcake-like burratas! Wash it down with a glass of Rioja\n(3€) or a refreshing beer.\n\n**15.30:** With all that fuel, it’s time to explore the east of the city.\nEnjoy the walk there, or catch the metro a few stops to Retiro station. Retiro\nPark is a beautiful, grand park with a large lake, plenty of monuments and\neven a small waterfall. Alternatively, spend an hour or two looking around the\nPrado Museum – home of one of the largest collections of European art,\nincluding Las Meninas by Velázquez. Find out exactly why it’s one of the best\nmuseums in Europe!\n\n**17.00:** When you’re ready for another pick me up, hop in a taxi to\nRestaurante Lope in the Malasaña district. This is a cute hidden gem with\nbuckets of character, and a satisfying jazz soundtrack. Plus the coffee is\nexcellent and served with a plate of biscuits!\n\n**18.00:** Energy levels sorted, stroll down Gran Via – the biggest street in\nthe city, known as the ‘Broadway’ of Madrid. Shop ‘til you drop, or just snap\naway at the grand buildings.\n\n**19.00:** After a rest and a change for dinner, it’s time to sample Madrid’s\ncheapest dinner option. Yes, many bars in Spain will present you with a small\nplate of tapas if you order a drink, but at El Tigre, you won’t need dinner\nafter. It’s cheap and cheerful, and as a result always busy. Spend an hour\ndrinking a gigantic 2€ glass of red wine, while munching on a plate stacked\nhigh with croquettes, montaditos with ham and cheese (topped sandwich),\ndelicious garlic mushrooms, Spanish tortilla. When you’ve finished that you\ncan start on the enormous ‘side plate’ of paella!\n\n**21.00:** Madrid has plenty of options when it comes to nightlife… most tapas\nbars turn into late night bars across the city, but depending on what’s on,\nCafé Central is a hot ticket in town. The sophisticated jazz club in Plaza Del\nAngel hosts some of the best performers from across the world. Shows start\nevery evening at 9, and booking is recommended.\n\n**23.30:** Post-jazz, stumble around the corner to El Imperfecto, a small\nunpretentious bar which strikes the perfect balance between being buzzy, and\nrelaxed. The décor is crazy… There’s a birdcage in the window, posters\ncovering every inch of wall space, fairy lights hung all over the bar. It’s a\nlot of fun! Try one of the many cocktails on offer including a whole menu\ndedicated to mojitos.\n\n**This post was originally written for Huffington Post.

The guide is written by Chloe Gunning, a UK-based travel blogger and influencer who has visited some of the coolest spots on the planet.\n\nThe guide covers a range of topics, including weather forecasts, transportation, accommodation, dining, and entertainment. Madrid's weather is usually pleasant, with mild winters and hot summers. The best time to visit is during the spring or fall when the weather is mild and the crowds are smaller.

However, it also uncovers some hidden gems, such as the Naval Museum of Madrid, which showcases the nation’s rich naval history, and the Monasterio de las Descalzas Reales, a 16th-century monastery that houses many works of art and relics. For modern art lovers, the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía offers a fantastic collection of modern art, including works by Picasso, Miró, Kandinsky, Dalí, and Bacon.\n\nMadrid's vibrant neighborhoods, such as Malasaña, Barrio de la Latina, Lavapiés, and Chuenca, offer a range of dining, entertainment, and cultural experiences. The guide provides detailed information on accommodation options, from budget hostels to luxury hotels.\n\nWhen visiting Madrid, it's important to take advantage of the city's public transportation system, which is efficient and affordable. Walking is also an excellent way to explore the city, as many of the main attractions are situated around the city center within walking distance from each other. For those looking to venture outside the city, there are many convenient and fun day trips from Madrid, such as Toledo, Avila, and Segovia, which are all easily accessible on Spain’s public transportation.\n\nThe guide includes a detailed 24-hour itinerary for Madrid, including recommendations for each hour's activities, meals, and accommodations. The itinerary includes stops at some of the city's most famous landmarks, as well as hidden gems, and a self-guided Madrid food tour through the local markets.

The city is also famous for its nightlife, with a variety of bars, clubs, and live music venues. Visitors can indulge in Madrid's fine-dining scene, with recommendations for some of the best restaurants in the city, such as Coque, Ramón Freixa Madrid, DTAgE, and DiverXO. These high-end restaurants offer exceptional food and a unique dining experience, making them worth the splurge. The guide also suggests checking out live shows, such as Flamenco performances and concerts, and being flexible with your itinerary to allow for unexpected discoveries.\n\nIn summary, Nomadic Matt's Madrid Travel Guide is an essential resource for anyone looking to explore Madrid's must-visit landmarks, hidden gems, cultural hotspots, and practical travel tips. The guide's detailed itinerary, dining recommendations, and money-saving advice make it an indispensable tool for travelers looking to make the most of their time in this vibrant and culturally-rich city.

The guide is written by Chloe Gunning, a UK-based travel blogger and influencer who has visited some of the coolest spots on the planet.\n\nThe guide covers a range of topics, including weather forecasts, transportation, accommodation, dining, and entertainment. Madrid's weather is usually pleasant, with mild winters and hot summers. The best time to visit is during the spring or fall when the weather is mild and the crowds are smaller. Visitors can expect to pay around 14 EUR per night for a bed in a room with 8 beds or more during the off-season, while basic private rooms for two with a private bathroom cost around 90 EUR per night during both peak and off-peak seasons.\n\nThe guide highlights some of Madrid's most famous landmarks, such as the Plaza Mayor, Prado Museum, El Retiro Park, Palacio Real, and the National Archaeological Museum. However, it also uncovers some hidden gems, such as the Naval Museum of Madrid, which showcases the nation’s rich naval history, and the Monasterio de las Descalzas Reales, a 16th-century monastery that houses many works of art and relics. For modern art lovers, the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía offers a fantastic collection of modern art, including works by Picasso, Miró, Kandinsky, Dalí, and Bacon.\n\nMadrid's vibrant neighborhoods, such as Malasaña, Barrio de la Latina, Lavapiés, and Chuenca, offer a range of dining, entertainment, and cultural experiences. The guide provides detailed information on accommodation options, from budget hostels to luxury hotels.\n\nWhen visiting Madrid, it's important to take advantage of the city's public transportation system, which is efficient and affordable. Walking is also an excellent way to explore the city, as many of the main attractions are situated around the city center within walking distance from each other. For those looking to venture outside the city, there are many convenient and fun day trips from Madrid, such as Toledo, Avila, and Segovia, which are all easily accessible on Spain’s public transportation.\n\nThe guide includes a detailed 24-hour itinerary for Madrid, including recommendations for each hour's activities, meals, and accommodations. The itinerary includes stops at some of the city's most famous landmarks, as well as hidden gems, and a self-guided Madrid food tour through the local markets. The guide's practical tips and money-saving advice make it an essential tool for travelers looking to make the most of their time in this vibrant and culturally-rich city.\n\nMoreover, the guide emphasizes Madrid's cultural hotspots, such as the Royal Palace, the Royal Theater, and the Reina Sofia Museum. The city is also famous for its nightlife, with a variety of bars, clubs, and live music venues. Visitors can indulge in Madrid's fine-dining scene, with recommendations for some of the best restaurants in the city, such as Coque, Ramón Freixa Madrid, DTAgE, and DiverXO. These high-end restaurants offer exceptional food and a unique dining experience, making them worth the splurge. The guide also suggests checking out live shows, such as Flamenco performances and concerts, and being flexible with your itinerary to allow for unexpected discoveries.\n\nIn summary, Nomadic Matt's Madrid Travel Guide is an essential resource for anyone looking to explore Madrid's must-visit landmarks, hidden gems, cultural hotspots, and practical travel tips. The guide's detailed itinerary, dining recommendations, and money-saving advice make it an indispensable tool for travelers looking to make the most of their time in this vibrant and culturally-rich city.

The guide is written by Chloe Gunning, a UK-based travel blogger and influencer who has visited some of the coolest spots on the planet.\n\nThe guide covers a range of topics, including weather forecasts, transportation, accommodation, dining, and entertainment. Madrid's weather is usually pleasant, with mild winters and hot summers. The best time to visit is during the spring or fall when the weather is mild and the crowds are smaller. Visitors can expect to pay around 14 EUR per night for a bed in a room with 8 beds or more during the off-season, while basic private rooms for two with a private bathroom cost around 90 EUR per night during both peak and off-peak seasons.\n\nThe guide highlights some of Madrid's most famous landmarks, such as the Plaza Mayor, Prado Museum, El Retiro Park, Palacio Real, and the National Archaeological Museum. However, it also uncovers some hidden gems, such as the Naval Museum of Madrid, which showcases the nation’s rich naval history, and the Monasterio de las Descalzas Reales, a 16th-century monastery that houses many works of art and relics. For modern art lovers, the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía offers a fantastic collection of modern art, including works by Picasso, Miró, Kandinsky, Dalí, and Bacon.\n\nMadrid's vibrant neighborhoods, such as Malasaña, Barrio de la Latina, Lavapiés, and Chuenca, offer a range of dining, entertainment, and cultural experiences. The guide provides detailed information on accommodation options, from budget hostels to luxury hotels.\n\nWhen visiting Madrid, it's important to take advantage of the city's public transportation system, which is efficient and affordable. Walking is also an excellent way to explore the city, as many of the main attractions are situated around the city center within walking distance from each other. For those looking to venture outside the city, there are many convenient and fun day trips from Madrid, such as Toledo, Avila, and Segovia, which are all easily accessible on Spain’s public transportation.\n\nThe guide includes a detailed 24-hour itinerary for Madrid, including recommendations for each hour's activities, meals, and accommodations. The itinerary includes stops at some of the city's most famous landmarks, as well as hidden gems, and a self-guided Madrid food tour through the local markets. The guide's practical tips and money-saving advice make it an essential tool for travelers looking to make the most of their time in this vibrant and culturally-rich city.\n\nMoreover, the guide emphasizes Madrid's cultural hotspots, such as the Royal Palace, the Royal Theater, and the Reina Sofia Museum. The city is also famous for its nightlife, with a variety of bars, clubs, and live music venues. Visitors can indulge in Madrid's fine-dining scene, with recommendations for some of the best restaurants in the city, such as Coque, Ramón Freixa Madrid, DTAgE, and DiverXO. These high-end restaurants offer exceptional food and a unique dining experience, making them worth the splurge. The guide also suggests checking out live shows, such as Flamenco performances and concerts, and being flexible with your itinerary to allow for unexpected discoveries.\n\nIn summary, Nomadic Matt's Madrid Travel Guide is an essential resource for anyone looking to explore Madrid's must-visit landmarks, hidden gems, cultural hotspots, and practical travel tips. The guide's detailed itinerary, dining recommendations, and money-saving advice make it an indispensable tool for travelers looking to make the most of their time in this vibrant and culturally-rich city.

The guide is written by Chloe Gunning, a UK-based travel blogger and influencer who has visited some of the coolest spots on the planet.\n\nThe guide covers a range of topics, including weather forecasts, transportation, accommodation, dining, and entertainment. Madrid's weather is usually pleasant, with mild winters and hot summers. The best time to visit is during the spring or fall when the weather is mild and the crowds are smaller. Visitors can expect to pay around 14 EUR per night for a bed in a room with 8 beds or more during the off-season, while basic private rooms for two with a private bathroom cost around 90 EUR per night during both peak and off-peak seasons.\n\nThe guide highlights some of Madrid's most famous landmarks, such as the Plaza Mayor, Prado Museum, El Retiro Park, Palacio Real, and the National Archaeological Museum. However, it also uncovers some hidden gems, such as the Naval Museum of Madrid, which showcases the nation’s rich naval history, and the Monasterio de las Descalzas Reales, a 16th-century monastery that houses many works of art and relics. For modern art lovers, the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía offers a fantastic collection of modern art, including works by Picasso, Miró, Kandinsky, Dalí, and Bacon.\n\nMadrid's vibrant neighborhoods, such as Malasaña, Barrio de la Latina, Lavapiés, and Chuenca, offer a range of dining, entertainment, and cultural experiences. The guide provides detailed information on accommodation options, from budget hostels to luxury hotels.\n\nWhen visiting Madrid, it's important to take advantage of the city's public transportation system, which is efficient and affordable. Walking is also an excellent way to explore the city, as many of the main attractions are situated around the city center within walking distance from each other. For those looking to venture outside the city, there are many convenient and fun day trips from Madrid, such as Toledo, Avila, and Segovia, which are all easily accessible on Spain’s public transportation.\n\nThe guide includes a detailed 24-hour itinerary for Madrid, including recommendations for each hour's activities, meals, and accommodations. The itinerary includes stops at some of the city's most famous landmarks, as well as hidden gems, and a self-guided Madrid food tour through the local markets. The guide's practical tips and money-saving advice make it an essential tool for travelers looking to make the most of their time in this vibrant and culturally-rich city.\n\nMoreover, the guide emphasizes Madrid's cultural hotspots, such as the Royal Palace, the Royal Theater, and the Reina Sofia Museum. The city is also famous for its nightlife, with a variety of bars, clubs, and live music venues. Visitors can indulge in Madrid's fine-dining scene, with recommendations for some of the best restaurants in the city, such as Coque, Ramón Freixa Madrid, DTAgE, and DiverXO. These high-end restaurants offer exceptional food and a unique dining experience, making them worth the splurge. The guide also suggests checking out live shows, such as Flamenco performances and concerts, and being flexible with your itinerary to allow for unexpected discoveries.\n\nIn summary, Nomadic Matt's Madrid Travel Guide is an essential resource for anyone looking to explore Madrid's must-visit landmarks, hidden gems, cultural hotspots, and practical travel tips. The guide's detailed itinerary, dining recommendations, and money-saving advice make it an indispensable tool for travelers looking to make the most of their time in this vibrant and culturally-rich city.

For those looking to venture outside the city, there are many convenient and fun day trips from Madrid, such as Toledo, Avila, and Segovia, which are all easily accessible on Spain’s public transportation.\n\nThe guide includes a detailed 24-hour itinerary for Madrid, including recommendations for each hour's activities, meals, and accommodations. The itinerary includes stops at some of the city's most famous landmarks, as well as hidden gems, and a self-guided Madrid food tour through the local markets.

These high-end restaurants offer exceptional food and a unique dining experience, making them worth the splurge. The guide also suggests checking out live shows, such as Flamenco performances and concerts, and being flexible with your itinerary to allow for unexpected discoveries.\n\nIn summary, Nomadic Matt's Madrid Travel Guide is an essential resource for anyone looking to explore Madrid's must-visit landmarks, hidden gems, cultural hotspots, and practical travel tips.

The guide is written by Chloe Gunning, a UK-based travel blogger and influencer who has visited some of the coolest spots on the planet.\n\nThe guide covers a range of topics, including weather forecasts, transportation, accommodation, dining, and entertainment. Madrid's weather is usually pleasant, with mild winters and hot summers. The best time to visit is during the spring or fall when the weather is mild and the crowds are smaller. Visitors can expect to pay around 14 EUR per night for a bed in a room with 8 beds or more during the off-season, while basic private rooms for two with a private bathroom cost around 90 EUR per night during both peak and off-peak seasons.\n\nThe guide highlights some of Madrid's most famous landmarks, such as the Plaza Mayor, Prado Museum, El Retiro Park, Palacio Real, and the National Archaeological Museum. However, it also uncovers some hidden gems, such as the Naval Museum of Madrid, which showcases the nation’s rich naval history, and the Monasterio de las Descalzas Reales, a 16th-century monastery that houses many works of art and relics. For modern art lovers, the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía offers a fantastic collection of modern art, including works by Picasso, Miró, Kandinsky, Dalí, and Bacon.\n\nMadrid's vibrant neighborhoods, such as Malasaña, Barrio de la Latina, Lavapiés, and Chuenca, offer a range of dining, entertainment, and cultural experiences. The guide provides detailed information on accommodation options, from budget hostels to luxury hotels.\n\nWhen visiting Madrid, it's important to take advantage of the city's public transportation system, which is efficient and affordable. Walking is also an excellent way to explore the city, as many of the main attractions are situated around the city center within walking distance from each other. For those looking to venture outside the city, there are many convenient and fun day trips from Madrid, such as Toledo, Avila, and Segovia, which are all easily accessible on Spain’s public transportation.\n\nThe guide includes a detailed 24-hour itinerary for Madrid, including recommendations for each hour's activities, meals, and accommodations. The itinerary includes stops at some of the city's most famous landmarks, as well as hidden gems, and a self-guided Madrid food tour through the local markets. The guide's practical tips and money-saving advice make it an essential tool for travelers looking to make the most of their time in this vibrant and culturally-rich city.\n\nMoreover, the guide emphasizes Madrid's cultural hotspots, such as the Royal Palace, the Royal Theater, and the Reina Sofia Museum. The city is also famous for its nightlife, with a variety of bars, clubs, and live music venues. Visitors can indulge in Madrid's fine-dining scene, with recommendations for some of the best restaurants in the city, such as Coque, Ramón Freixa Madrid, DTAgE, and DiverXO. These high-end restaurants offer exceptional food and a unique dining experience, making them worth the splurge. The guide also suggests checking out live shows, such as Flamenco performances and concerts, and being flexible with your itinerary to allow for unexpected discoveries.\n\nIn summary, Nomadic Matt's Madrid Travel Guide is an essential resource for anyone looking to explore Madrid's must-visit landmarks, hidden gems, cultural hotspots, and practical travel tips.

The guide provides detailed information on accommodation options, from budget hostels to luxury hotels.\n\nWhen visiting Madrid, it's important to take advantage of the city's public transportation system, which is efficient and affordable. Walking is also an excellent way to explore the city, as many of the main attractions are situated around the city center within walking distance from each other. For those looking to venture outside the city, there are many convenient and fun day trips from Madrid, such as Toledo, Avila, and Segovia, which are all easily accessible on Spain’s public transportation.\n\nThe guide includes a detailed 24-hour itinerary for Madrid, including recommendations for each hour's activities, meals, and accommodations.
