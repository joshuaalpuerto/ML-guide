Head to **Town Hall\nSquare** to visit the 15th-century hall plus Europe's oldest continuously-\noperating pharmacy. You won't miss **Toompea Hill** , atop which sits a castle\nthat now houses Estonia's Parliament. You'll also visit the **Cathedral of\nSaint Mary** (which dates to the 13th century) and the Russian Revival\n**Alexander Nevsky Cathedral**.  \n  \nAfter the tour, enjoy a traditional Estonian meal at the oldest-operating\neatery in Tallinn, the **Maiasmokk Café**. Also here is a marzipan museum\nwhere a local artist decorates marzipan figures.  \n  \nSpend the rest of the day at **Kadriorg Park** , home to an impressive baroque\npalace built for Catherine I of Russia. Visit the art museum, home to exhibits\nfrom the 16th through the 20th century, then take a stroll around the grounds.\nHere you'll find manicured lawns, Dutch-style canals, French-inspired\npathways, and a Russian garden.

At 20\nfeet (6 meters) high, it's one of the most powerful waterfalls in the country\naside from **Narva Waterfall** and **Jägala Waterfall**.  \n  \nAlong the way, you'll stop at the coastal limestone cliffs in **Turisalu**  as\nwell as **Padise Abbey** , a Cistercian monastery that dates to the early 14th\ncentury. Nearby is a closed military town plus the **Murru Prison** and\n**Rummu Quarry** , all of which provide insight into the country's wartime\nhistory.  \n **  \n**After the waterfall, you'll drive another hour down the coast to the seaside\nresort town of Haapsalu, which is known for its narrow streets, romantic\nwooden houses, and seaside promenade. Visit **Haapsalu Castle** , which was\nfounded in the middle of the 13th century and was used until the end of the\n17th century.  \n **  \n**Later in the afternoon, you'll settle into your accommodation at a spa\nhotel. Here you can enjoy relaxing treatments before dinner.\n\n**Plan your trip to Estonia**  \nChat with a local specialist who can help organize your trip.\n\nGet Started\n\n### Day 3: Explore Lahemaa National Park\n\nMarshland in Lahemaa National Park\n\nEnjoy breakfast at your hotel, then meet your driver for a trip to **Lahemaa**\n**National Park**.

You'll also stop at the nearby submarine base\nplus fishermen's houses and historic manor estates, including **Palmse\nManor**. It doubles as a museum of the Baltic-German aristocracy, complete\nwith a wine cellar that contains more than 130 varietals including local\nsweet-berry wines.  \n  \nAfter touring the park you'll return to Tallinn. Along the way, your guide\nwill point out unique places and reveal historical facts to help you better\nunderstand the culture of northern Estonia.

And while Tallinn does have a lot to offer, it’s worth\nspending at least 5 to 7 days in Estonia to really get a feel for the country.\n\nEstonia has a lot to offer visitors from charming towns to gorgeous beaches to\nlush national parks. And though the country is small, there is quite a lot to\nsee that if you only have around a week to spend in the region, you should\ndefinitely consider planning a dedicated Estonia trip rather than trying to\ncram in other Baltic cities like Riga or Vilnius instead.\n\nThis itinerary will take you to some of the highlights of this country to help\nyou get a great feel for this beautiful Baltic nation.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nToggle\n\n  * How Many Days in Estonia?\n  * Getting To & Around Estonia\n  * 5 to 7 Days in Estonia Itinerary\n    * Day 1 – Tallinn\n    * Day 2 – Tallinn\n    * Day 3 – Lahemaa National Park\n    * Day 4 – Tartu\n    * Day 5 – Tartu\n    * Day 6 – Saaremaa\n    * Day 7 – Saaremaa\n  * Have More Time?\n\n## How Many Days in Estonia?\n\nMany travellers in the planning stages of their trips wonder how many days to\nspend in Estonia in order to cover a lot of ground but not feel rushed.\n\nAnd the answer to this can really depend on what you’re after. If you only\nhave a few days, plan to spend your time in Tallinn. To do the city justice,\nyou will need to spend at least two days exploring the city itself and plan to\nspend another on a day trip to the surrounding area.\n\nIf you have 5 days in Estonia, this is where you can venture out a bit further\nand explore a little bit more. If you want to explore another Estonia city,\nconsider visiting the second-largest city of Tartu, which is vibrant and\nabsolutely charming.\n\nYou could also opt to, instead, head to Estonia’s largest island of Saaremaa\nand explore this gorgeous place. Or, if it’s the beach you’re after, consider\nadding a couple of days in Parnu to your itinerary\n\nIf you have one week in Estonia, then you have a lot more flexibility. In\nfact, this would be the recommended amount of time to spend here (if not\nlonger). Though you still won’t be able to visit everywhere of interest in the\ncountry, you will be able to cover a lot of ground.\n\nOf course, there are so many places to see and enjoy in Estonia that you can\ncertainly spend more than one week. However, if you want to get a lot of the\ndestination and you do only have a limited amount of time to play around with,\nfive to seven days can be just fine.\n\nLahemaa National Park in Estonia\n\n## Getting To & Around Estonia\n\nIf you are only planning on visiting Estonia, you will likely be arriving into\nthe capital city of Tallinn. Tallinn is home to its own international airport\nthat, while small, serves several different European destinations and some\nthat are further afield.\n\nIt’s also entirely possible that you’re arriving to Estonia via ferry.\nTallinn’s port has direct connections with Helsinki, Finland and some of the\nFinnish Islands among other destinations. The port of Paldiski (about 50km\nwest of Tallinn) has connections to Stockholm, Sweden as well.\n\nEstonia is also well-connected by bus to neighbouring Latvia, so it is very\neasy to visit both countries as part of a longer Baltics itinerary.\n\nOnce in Estonia, you do have a few options on how to get around. If you are\nonly spending 5 days in Estonia and plan to only visit Tallinn and Tartu, you\ncan definitely do that while relying solely on public transport. Estonia has a\nbroad bus network that is easy to use and very convenient. You can **browse\nschedules here.**\n\nIf you follow the 7-day Estonia itinerary, you may find it easiest to do this\nif you have your own car, though this isn’t entirely necessary. For those who\nwant a lot of flexibility and want to get off the beaten path even further,\nthen renting a car and planning an Estonia road trip is probably going to be\nyour best option. This also allows you to be able to make some stops in\nbetween destinations, as well.\n\nIf you do want to hire a car while in Estonia, we suggest **browsing\nRentalcars.com** to compare prices across a range of different rental\ncompanies.\n\nBeautiful Tallinn from the Patkuli Viewing Platform\n\n## 5 to 7 Days in Estonia Itinerary\n\n### Day 1 – Tallinn\n\nBegin your Estonia trip in the beautiful capital of Tallinn. While the Old\nTown is very popular with tourists, it’s worth spending some time here\n(especially in the morning or evening before or after the cruise ship crowds\nhave dispersed) to really take in its splendour.\n\nKnown to be one of the most well-preserved medieval old towns in Europe, it’s\nsure to take your breath away.\n\nSpend a few hours exploring the UNESCO World Heritage Old Town either\nindependently or **on a walking tour** and learning about the history of this\nside of the city. Some of the highlights include the Town Hall Square,\nAlexander Nevsky Cathedral and the Patkuli Viewing Platform.\n\nAfterwards, head outside of the old town to explore the trendy Kalamaja\nneighbourhood which was traditionally the home of local fishermen but has been\ntransformed in recent years to be a hip area full of cafes, bars and boutique\nshops.\n\nIf you want to see an alternative side of the city (and find a great place for\na meal), make sure to head to the Telliskivi Creative City, as well.\n\nStreet art in Telliskivi\n\n#### Where to Stay in Tallinn\n\n **Citybox Tallinn** – If you’re after for a good mid-range option, this\ncentrally located hotel is a great choice. Situated within easy walking\ndistance of Tallinn’s Old Town, harbour, Telliskivi and Kalamaja, they have a\nrange of clean and comfortable rooms on offer.\n\n **Savoy Boutique Hotel** – This boutique hotel has several lovely rooms\navailable all within easy distance of the top attractions in Tallinn.\n\n **Bob W Telliskivi** – Located near hip Telliskivi Creative City, they have a\nfew fully-furnished apartments that can suit visitors who prefer self-catering\nfacilities.",

We are headed to Tallinn from Nov\n8-13 (which leaves us four full days). Is it worth going to Laheema and the\nfalls at this time of the year? I also thought about renting a car for two\nnights to go both here and then another excursion (whether it be the Tartu or\nNarva. You did take the option of going to Helsinki off the table for a day\ntrip as I feel like it would be rushed.\n\nReply\n\n      * Maggie Turansky\n\nMay 25, 2023 at 1:49 pm\n\nHi Scott – I think it’s definitely still worth it to head to Lahemaa. It will\nbe chilly but certainly will still be beautiful. Personally, I would recommend\nheading to Tartu because it’s a really nice little city. I haven’t been to\nNarva so I can’t offer any advice on that end 🙂\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a Comment Cancel reply\n\nComment\n\nName Email Website\n\n## Search\n\nSearch for:\n\n## About Us\n\nHi!

Situated in\nKuressaare, they are pet friendly and have a shared kitchen where you can\nprepare your own meals should you wish.\n\nNot quite what you’re looking for? **Click here to browse more Saaremaa\nhotels!**  \n\nKuressaare Castle\n\n### Day 7 – Saaremaa\n\nOn your final day in Estonia, take the time to explore a bit more of Saaremaa\nbefore grabbing a later ferry and heading back to Tallinn. You could take the\ntime to visit the gorgeous Tuhkana Beach on the north of the island or visit\nthe imposing Panga Cliffs.\n\nOnce you’ve made it back to the mainland, consider making a pit stop in the\nlovely town of Haapsalu on the coast. This is the jumping-off point for\nheading to Hiiumaa Island, however, the town is absolutely lovely and worth\nexploring in its own right.\n\nHaapsalu’s old railway station has a fascinating collection of defunct trains\nto view and the city centre has an interesting medieval castle to explore. The\nmain town is also very charming and there are plenty of great places to eat in\nthe town, as well.\n\nFrom Haapsalu, it is about 1.5 hours driving to get back to Tallinn.\n\nHaapsalu Railway Museum\n\n## Have More Time?\n\nIf you have more than a week in Estonia, then there are plenty of ways you can\noccupy your time. If you’re after for a seaside getaway, then make sure to\nspend a couple of days in the lovely city of Parnu on the Baltic Sea.\n\nAlternatively, you could also opt to explore Estonia’s third-largest city of\nNarva, which is located in the east of the country close to the Russian\nborder.\n\nAnd if you are interested in visiting some more islands, hop on a ferry to\nHiiumaa to explore even further.\n\nParnu Mud Baths\n\n **There is so much to see and do in Estonia beyond Tallinn that it is so\nworth trying to plan at least a week in this beautiful country. No matter how\nlong you have to spend here, however, you are sure to leave with lasting\nmemories.**\n\n _Are you planning a trip to Estonia?

Debbie Newmeyer\n\nMarch 11, 2023 at 7:02 pm\n\nHi Maggie,  \nLoved your blog! My husband and I are headed to Estonia and are staying in\nTallinn, Taagepera and Parnu. We have 8 days to travel and sightsee.  \nI’m having trouble finding a private driver that can crive us through the\ncountry also acting as a tour guide. Was hoping you might have a name of\nsomeone or a company that would act as our guide. Thanks for any help you can\ngive me. Debbie\n\nReply\n\n    * Maggie Turansky\n\nMarch 17, 2023 at 1:01 pm\n\nThanks for your kind words, Debbie! Unfortunately, we don’t work with any\nprivate drivers so I’m not able to help you there 🙂\n\nReply\n\n    * Scott\n\nMay 23, 2023 at 2:43 am\n\nHi Maggie,\n\nI found a site that gave me all Estonia!! We are headed to Tallinn from Nov\n8-13 (which leaves us four full days). Is it worth going to Laheema and the\nfalls at this time of the year? I also thought about renting a car for two\nnights to go both here and then another excursion (whether it be the Tartu or\nNarva. You did take the option of going to Helsinki off the table for a day\ntrip as I feel like it would be rushed.\n\nReply\n\n      * Maggie Turansky\n\nMay 25, 2023 at 1:49 pm\n\nHi Scott – I think it’s definitely still worth it to head to Lahemaa. It will\nbe chilly but certainly will still be beautiful. Personally, I would recommend\nheading to Tartu because it’s a really nice little city. I haven’t been to\nNarva so I can’t offer any advice on that end 🙂\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a Comment Cancel reply\n\nComment\n\nName Email Website\n\n## Search\n\nSearch for:\n\n## About Us\n\nHi!
