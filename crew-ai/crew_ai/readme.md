# Your travel buddy

## Description

A simple project that helps me navigate how to use Multi Agent process. This is a modified version of this example project from [CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI-examples/tree/main/trip_planner). 

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following:

- [Fireworks.ai](https://fireworks.ai/)
  - I'm using their [Mixtral MoE 8x7B](https://fireworks.ai/models) alternative to OpenAI as it much-much [cheaper](https://fireworks.ai/pricing) with good results.

## How to run
1. Open `flight-recommender/cli.py` and change these details
```js
origin = "Tallinn, Estonia"
destination = "Madrid, Spain"
date_range = "2024-04-01 - 2024-04-05"
interests = "history, food, local experience"
```

2. Run the `cli.py`
```bash
python cli.py
```

3. You can check the logged output in [myoutput.txt](https://github.com/joshuaalpuerto/ML-guide/blob/main/crew-ai/crew_ai/flight-recommender/myoutput.txt)
```bash
[DEBUG]: [Travel Planner] Task output: # Madrid Itinerary: 2024-04-01 - 2024-04-05
