<!--
- It is inspired by `System 2` cognitive thinking where we think slow and carefuly to analyze what we need to do.
- It improves the LLM result by A LOT.
- The underlying concept is that we break the task into:
    - Thought decomposition - Decompose the task at hand.
    - Thought generation - Generate potential next steps base on the task we have.
    - State evaluator - Identify which thoughts is promising and go for it.
    - Search algorithm - Sythesize the information gathered from the result of each state.

<!--Thought decomposition-->
Imagine three different experts are answering this question.
They will brainstorm the answer step by step reasoning carefully and taking all facts into consideration
<!--Thought Generation-->
All experts will write down 1 step of their thinking,
then share it with the group.
<!--State evaulator-->
They will each critique their response, and the all the responses of others
They will check their answer based on science and the laws of physics
Then all experts will go on to the next step and write down this step of their thinking.
<!--Search algorithm-->
They will keep going through steps until they reach their conclusion taking into account the thoughts of the other experts
<!--State evaulator-->
If at any time they realise that there is a flaw in their logic they will backtrack to where that flaw occurred 
<!--Thought Generation-->
If any expert realises they're wrong at any point then they acknowledges this and start another train of thought
<!--State evaulator-->
Each expert will assign a likelihood of their current assertion being correct
<!--Search algorithm-->
Continue until the experts agree on the single most likely location
The question is...

1. Carlos is at the swimming pool.
2. He walks to the locker room, carrying a towel.
3. He puts his watch in the towel and carries the towel tightly to a lounger at the poolside.
4. At the lounger he opens and vigorously shakes the towel, then walks to the snack bar.
5. He leaves the towel at the snack bar, then walks to the diving board.
6. Later Carlos realises he has has lost his watch. Where is the single most likely location of the watch?
