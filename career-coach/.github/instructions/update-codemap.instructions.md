# Update Code Map Documentation

Update the code map documentation located at `career-coach/.specify/memory/CODE_MAP.md` whenever you introduce new components, libraries, or significant changes to the project structure. Ensure that the code map accurately reflects the current state of the codebase, including file paths and brief descriptions of their purpose.

## Steps to Update Code Map
1. **Identify Changes**: Review the recent changes made to the codebase, including new files, deleted files, or significant modifications to existing files.
2. **Update Entries**: For each change, update the `CODE_MAP.md` file:
   - **New Files**: Add a new entry with the file path and a brief description of its purpose.
   - **Deleted Files**: Remove the corresponding entry from the code map.
   - **Modified Files**: Update the description if the purpose or functionality of the file has changed significantly.
3. **Maintain Consistency**: Ensure that the formatting and structure of the `CODE_MAP.md` file remain consistent with existing entries.
4. **Review**: After making updates, review the `CODE_MAP.md` file for accuracy and completeness.
5. **Commit Changes**: Commit the updated `CODE_MAP.md` file to the repository with a clear commit message indicating the updates made.

## Best Practices
- Regularly update the code map as part of your development workflow to prevent discrepancies.
- Use clear and concise descriptions for each file to aid in understanding the codebase structure.
- Collaborate with team members to ensure that all changes are captured in the code map.
